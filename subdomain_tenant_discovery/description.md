# Subdomain tenant discovery
ID: SAT1035

## Tactics
* Reconnassiance

## Summary
SaaS vendors make use of different strategies to separate different tenants from one another. One of these methods is the use of a unique subdomain, which is often picked during the creation of a new tenant.

Consequently, DNS enumeration techniques to discover valid subdomains can give an insight into who uses a given SaaS app. For example, adversaries can use DNS brute forcing or passive DNS enumeration to discover this information.

Itâ€™s common for the organization name itself to be used, making it easy to discover these tenant names or subdomains.
